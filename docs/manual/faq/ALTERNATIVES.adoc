== I don't like BDisk. Are there any other alternatives?
First, I'm sorry to hear that BDisk doesn't suit your needs. If you want any features you think are missing or encounter any <<FURTHER.adoc#bug_reports_feature_requests, bugs>>, please report them!

But yes; there are plenty of alternatives! I encourage you to search for yourself, but I've tried to be as impartial as I can for the below.

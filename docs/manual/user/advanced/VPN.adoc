=== VPN Configuration
For this example we'll set up an https://openvpn.net/[OpenVPN^] client to start automatically on boot.

Setting up an OpenVPN server is outside the scope of this section, but there are a https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html[multitude^] of https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/examples.html[useful^] https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/OpenVPN[documentation^] https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Openvpn[sources^] out there that will help you with that.

However, once you have your client .ovpn file (in our example, we'll call it `client.ovpn`) you can add it to the build relatively easily.

Copy `client.ovpn` as `<basedir>/overlay/etc/openvpn/client/client.conf` -- note the changed file extension. Then, in the `<basedir>/overlay/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/` directory, issue these commands:

 ln -s /usr/lib/systemd/system/openvpn-client\@.service openvpn-client\@client.service

OpenVPN will then start on boot in the built BDisk instance.

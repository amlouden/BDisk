=== Automatic Login (TTY)
If you don't want to have to log into the TTY on boot, BDisk can automatically log in for you with a given username.

If, for example, you want a terminal to auto-login on TTY1 with the root user, you would create the following file at `<basedir>/overlay/etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/autologin.conf`: 

 [Service]
 Type=idle
 ExecStart=
 ExecStart=-/usr/bin/agetty --autologin root --noclear %I 38400 linux

=== docs/
This directory contains various documentation and other helpful text.

==== COPYING
This contains BDisk's license, the GPLv3.

==== LICENSE
This is simply a link to `COPYING`.

==== manual/
This directory contains the documentation source you're reading right now! It's written in http://asciidoc.org/[asciidoc^] (well, to be more precise it's written in/has some http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor^]-isms). I'd recommend reading the rendered version, as the source (while perfectly human-readable) is written in a very modular fashion so it may be inconvenient to read each source file and following include directives.

==== README
This is a placeholder for common convention; it simply tells you to read the manual (and where to find it/build it).

== Building a BDisk ISO
So you finally have <<the_code_build_ini_code_file,configured>> BDisk (and perhaps added further <<advanced_customization,customizations>>. Now you're ready to build!

Building is, thankfully, the easiest part!

NOTE: Due to requiring various mounting and chrooting, BDisk must be run as the *root* user (or via _sudo_).

To initiate a build, simply run `<basedir>/bdisk/bdisk.py`. That's it! Everything should continue automatically.

If you're using a packaged version you installed from your distro's package manager, you instead should run wherever it installs to. Most likely this is going to be `/usr/sbin/bdisk`. (On systemd build hosts that have done the https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/TheCaseForTheUsrMerge/[/usr merge^], you can use `/usr/sbin/bdisk` or `/sbin/bdisk`.)

If you encounter any issues during the process, make sure you read the documentation -- if your issue still isn't addressed, please be sure to file a <<bug_reports_feature_requests,bug report>>!

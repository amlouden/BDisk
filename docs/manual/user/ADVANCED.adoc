== Advanced Customization
If the <<the_code_build_ini_code_file,`build.ini`>> file doesn't provide enough customization to your liking, I don't blame you! It was designed only to provide the most basic control and is primarily only used to control the build process itself.

Luckily, there are a lot of changes you can make. For all of these, you'll want to make a copy of the <<code_basedir_code,`basedir`>> directory somewhere and change the basedir configuration option in the <<the_code_build_ini_code_file,`build.ini`>> file to point to that directory.

This section isn't going to cover every single use case, as that's mostly an exercise for you -- I can't predict how you want to use BDisk! But we'll cover some common cases you can use and in the process you'll know how to implement your own customizations.

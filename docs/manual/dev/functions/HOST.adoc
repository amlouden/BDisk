=== `host.py`
These functions are used to perform "meta" tasks such as get information about the build host, find <<the_code_build_ini_code_file,the `build.ini` file>>, and parse your configuration options.

==== getOS()
Returns the distribution of the build host.

==== getBits()
Returns the "bitness" of the build host (e.g. `32bit` or `64bit`)

==== getHostname()
Returns the hostname of the build host.

==== getConfig(_conf_file_ = '/etc/bdisk/build.ini')
Returns a list of:

. the default configuration file
. the user-specified configuration file

===== conf_file
This is a full/absolute path that is searched first. If it exists and is a file, it is assumed to be the "canonical" <<the_code_build_ini_code_file,`build.ini` file>>.

==== parseConfig(_confs_)
This function parses the configuration file(s) and returns a list of:

. A ConfigParser object
. The configuration as a dictionary

It performs some additional things, such as:

* Converts "boolean" operations to true Python booleans
* Tries to automatically detect the version if one isn't provided
* Establishes the build number (this is a number that should be local to the build host)
* Forms a list of the <<code_multiarch_code,architectures>> to build
* Validates:
** The bootstrap tarball mirror
** The rsync destination (if <<code_rsync_code,enabled>>)
** The iPXE remote URI (if <<code_ipxe_code,enabled>>)
** That <<code_basedir_code>> is correctly set
* Makes prerequisite directories

===== confs
A list of configuration files. See <<getconfig_em_conf_file_em_etc_bdisk_build_ini,getConfig()>>.

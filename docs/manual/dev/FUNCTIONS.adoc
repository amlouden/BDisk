These functions exist in <<_bdisk_,`bdisk/`>>.

=== `bdisk.py`
This file is a sort of "wrapper" -- it pulls all the other files in this directory together into a single usable Python script. In other words, to build a BDisk distribution, you would simply run `bdisk/bdisk.py` -- that's it! See <<building_a_bdisk_iso>>.

It contains no functions, it just contains minimal logic to tie all the other functions together.

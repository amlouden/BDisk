== Bug Reports/Feature Requests
NOTE: It is possible to submit a bug or feature request without registering in my bugtracker. One of my pet peeves is needing to create an account/register on a bugtracker simply to report a bug! The following links only require an email address to file a bug (which is necessary in case I need any further clarification from you or to keep you updated on the status of the bug/feature request -- so please be sure to use a valid email address).

=== Bugs
If you encounter any bugs in *BDisk*, you can file a bug report https://bugs.square-r00t.net/index.php?do=newtask&project=2&task_type=1[here^].

If you encounter any bugs (inaccurate information, typos, misformatting, etc.) in *this documentation*, you can file a bug report https://bugs.square-r00t.net/index.php?do=newtask&project=8&task_type=1[here^].

=== Feature Requests
If you have any features you'd like to see or you think would help *BDisk* become even more useful, please file a feature request https://bugs.square-r00t.net/index.php?do=newtask&project=2&task_type=2[here^].

If you have any suggestions on how to improve *this documentation* or feel it's missing information that could be useful, please file a feature request https://bugs.square-r00t.net/index.php?do=newtask&project=8&task_type=2[here^].

=== Patches
I gladly welcome https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Unified-Format.html[patches^], but I deplore using GitHub (even though I https://github.com/johnnybubonic/BDisk[have a mirror there^]). For this reason, please follow the same https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches[patch/pull request process^] for the Linux kernel and email it to bts@square-r00t.net.

Alternatively, you may attach a patch to a <<bugs,bug report>>/<<feature_requests,feature request>>.
